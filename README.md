# MacDragSwift

heavily based on https://github.com/vessuria/MacDrag, but i got nerdsniped into writing a Swift version. hold Control and drag on a window to move it, use the right mouse button instead to resize. while dragging, tap Option to focus the window. i swapped Control and Option from the original so that the default macOS functionality for Option-clicking on an inactive app still works.
