# MacDragSwift

heavily based on https://github.com/vessuria/MacDrag, but i got nerdsniped into writing a swift version. hold control and drag on a window to move it, use the right mouse button instead to resize. while dragging, tap option to focus the window. i swapped control and option from the original so that the default macOS functionality for option-clicking on an inactive app still works.
